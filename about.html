        <h3>A Brief History of Spread Eagles Industries</h3>
        <p>The premises occupied by Spread Eagles Industries was used to build a furniture factory during the late 1950's. This Factory was built and operated by Mr.Roy Kelly, mainly producing furniture for the Courts furniture stores.In those days Mr. Roy
            Kelly became a leading supplier of furniture to "Courts."</p>

        <p>When Mr. kelly Retired the premises was bought by Mr.Noel Watson, who continued to supply furniture to "Courts" with company name changed to "Find Heart". The name of the managers of "Find Heart" were Noel Watson and Keith McFarlane. Today, Mr.Noel
            Watson is on the verge of going into retirement from the furniture business and is taking steps to pass the business to his two son's, Omar Watson and Chavonne Watson</p>
        <p>Since Mr.Noel Watson became the owner, the factory space has been improved and now occupies 6,400 square feet of ground floor space (80 ft Ã— 80 ft on the ground floor), with plans to establish a second floor at the location. Mr. Watson changed
            the name of the business twice since taking ownership (from "M&N" Furnishing to "Spread Eagles Industries") </p>
        <P>Spread Eagles Industries is led by a team of experienced furniture industry professionals and craftsmen, who bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise to the company. We are confident that our combination of quality products, sustainable practices,
            and strong management will drive the success of our company.</P>
