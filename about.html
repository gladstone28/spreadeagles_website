        <h3>A Brief History of Spread Eagles Industries</h3>
        <map>Duting the late 1950's Mr. Roy Kelly built a furniture factory at the premises now occupied by Spread Eagles Industries. Mr. Kelly produced furniture for Courts funiture stores and became a leading producer of furniture for that company</map>

        <p>When Mr. kelly retired the premises was bought by Mr.Noel Watson, who continued to supply furniture to "Courts" with his company name now changed to "Find Heart". The managers of "Find Heart" were Noel Watson and Keith McFarlane. Today, Mr.Noel
            Watson is on the verge of going into retirement from the furniture business and is taking steps to pass the business to his two son's, Omar Watson and Chavonne Watson</p>
        <p>Since Mr.Noel Watson became the owner, the factory space has been improved and now occupies 6,400 square feet of ground floor space (80 ft Ã— 80 ft on the ground floor), with plans to establish a second floor at the location. Mr. Watson further
            changed the name of the business twice (from "M&N" Furnishing to "Spread Eagles Industries") </p>
        <P>Spread Eagles Industries is led by a team of experienced furniture industry professionals and craftsmen, who bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise to the company. We are confident that our combination of quality products, sustainable practices,
            and strong management will drive the success of our company.</P>
